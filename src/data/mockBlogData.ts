    content: `# QR Code Design Mastery: Creating Beautiful, Functional Codes That Convert

Great QR code design is where art meets science. It's not just about making codes that scan—it's about creating visual experiences that attract, engage, and convert users while maintaining perfect functionality.

## The Psychology of QR Code Design

### Visual Trust Factors
Users make snap judgments about QR codes in **50 milliseconds**. Your design must immediately communicate:
- **Safety**: "This code is trustworthy"
- **Value**: "Scanning this will benefit me"
- **Professionalism**: "This brand is credible"
- **Clarity**: "I know what will happen when I scan"

## Technical Design Fundamentals

### The Contrast Rule
**Minimum contrast ratio: 4.5:1**
- Light background + dark foreground = Always works
- Dark background + light foreground = Often fails
- Colored combinations = Requires testing

### Size Optimization Guidelines
| Use Case | Minimum Size | Recommended Size |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| Business Cards | 1.5cm x 1.5cm | 2cm x 2cm |
| Posters/Flyers | 2cm x 2cm | 3cm x 3cm |
| Digital Screens | 100px x 100px | 150px x 150px |

Great QR code design isn't just about aesthetics—it's about creating seamless bridges between physical and digital experiences that users actually want to cross.`,
