- Real-time data fetching from Firebase
- Statistics display (Total QR Codes, This Month, Total Scans, Avg Scans/Code)
- Recent QR codes list with proper empty states
- Upgrade buttons (all functional)
- Loading states and error handling

#### 🚧 NEEDS VERIFICATION/IMPLEMENTATION:

1. **QR Code Management**:

   - ✅ View recent QR codes
   - ❓ Create new QR code from Dashboard
   - ❓ Edit existing QR codes
   - ❓ Delete QR codes
   - ❓ Download QR codes (PNG, SVG, PDF)

2. **Analytics Deep Dive**:

   - ✅ Basic statistics display
   - ❓ View detailed analytics page
   - ❓ Geographic insights (Pro feature)
   - ❓ Scan timeline and trends

3. **Free vs Pro Feature Restrictions**:

   - ✅ Monthly usage limits (5 QR codes for Free)
   - ❓ Feature lockouts for Pro-only features
   - ❓ Custom branding restrictions
   - ❓ Download format restrictions

4. **User Experience**:
   - ✅ Quick actions sidebar
   - ❓ QR code search and filtering
   - ❓ Bulk operations (Pro feature)
   - ❓ Export/import functionality

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps

### Phase 3: Complete Dashboard Functionality

1. **QR Code CRUD Operations**:

   - Verify "Create New QR Code" button works
   - Implement QR code editing from Dashboard
   - Add delete functionality with confirmation
   - Test download functionality

2. **Analytics Enhancement**:

   - Verify "View Analytics" button functionality
   - Implement detailed analytics page
   - Add Pro-only analytics features

3. **Free vs Pro Enforcement**:

   - Test monthly limits and restrictions
   - Verify Pro feature unlocking after upgrade
   - Test feature restriction messaging

4. **User Experience Polish**:
   - Mobile responsiveness testing
   - Performance optimization
   - Error boundary implementation

### Testing Strategy:

- Manual testing of each feature end-to-end
- Create test cases for QR code CRUD operations
- Verify Stripe subscription status affects feature access
- Test edge cases and error scenarios

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### Testing Approach:

- Service-layer testing avoids circular dependency issues
- Component testing with proper mocking provides good coverage
- Full integration testing can be complex - focus on isolated testing patterns

### Stripe Integration:

- Environment variables must be exported in shell, not just in .env file
- Production deployment requires proper Stripe key validation
- Error handling improves user experience significantly

### Documentation:

- Keep documentation updated with each major change
- Provide clear status indicators (✅❓🚧) for feature completion
- Document both successes and lessons learned
