# Deployment & Operations

## Production Deployment & Operations

This section covers deployment procedures, environment management, monitoring, and operational considerations for ToolzHub.

## 🚀 Deployment Overview

ToolzHub uses Firebase for hosting and deployment with automated CI/CD pipelines for reliable production deployments.

### Deployment Architecture

- **Firebase Hosting**: Static site hosting with global CDN
- **Cloud Functions**: Serverless API deployment
- **Firestore**: Database deployment and security rules
- **Environment Management**: Multi-environment configuration

### Deployment Environments

- **Development**: Local development with Firebase emulators
- **Staging**: Pre-production testing environment
- **Production**: Live production environment

## 🔧 Deployment Process

### Automated Deployment

**Use VS Code Tasks for deployment commands:**

**Available Deployment Tasks** (Access via Terminal > Run Task):

- **Build for Production**: Build optimized production version
- **Deploy All Services**: Deploy hosting, functions, and firestore rules
- **Deploy Hosting Only**: Deploy frontend assets only
- **Deploy Functions Only**: Deploy cloud functions only
- **Deploy Database Rules**: Deploy firestore security rules only

> **💡 Task Usage**: Use `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" for deployment instead of direct terminal commands

### Manual Deployment Steps

1. **Code Review**: Ensure all code is reviewed and tested
2. **Build Process**: Generate production-optimized build
3. **Environment Variables**: Verify all configuration is correct
4. **Database Migration**: Apply any required database changes
5. **Function Deployment**: Deploy updated Cloud Functions
6. **Static Assets**: Deploy frontend assets to Firebase Hosting
7. **Verification**: Post-deployment testing and verification
