      content: `# QR Code Design Mastery: Creating Beautiful, Functional Codes That Convert

Great QR code design is where art meets science. It's not just about making codes that scan—it's about creating visual experiences that attract, engage, and convert users while maintaining perfect functionality.

## 🎨 The Psychology of QR Code Design

### Visual Trust Factors
Users make snap judgments about QR codes in **50 milliseconds**. Your design must immediately communicate:
- **Safety**: "This code is trustworthy"
- **Value**: "Scanning this will benefit me"
- **Professionalism**: "This brand is credible"
- **Clarity**: "I know what will happen when I scan"

### Color Psychology in QR Codes
\`\`\`
🎨 Color Impact on User Behavior:
• Black/White: Professional, trustworthy (96% scan rate)
• Blue: Technology, reliability (89% scan rate)
• Green: Growth, health, eco-friendly (92% scan rate)
• Red: Urgency, excitement (85% scan rate)
• Purple: Luxury, creativity (78% scan rate)
\`\`\`

## 🔧 Technical Design Fundamentals

### The Contrast Rule
**Minimum contrast ratio: 4.5:1**
- Light background + dark foreground = ✅ Always works
- Dark background + light foreground = ❌ Often fails
- Colored combinations = 🔍 Requires testing

### Size Optimization Guidelines
| Use Case | Minimum Size | Recommended Size |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| Business Cards | 1.5cm x 1.5cm | 2cm x 2cm |
| Posters/Flyers | 2cm x 2cm | 3cm x 3cm |
| Billboards | 10cm x 10cm | 15cm x 15cm |
| Digital Screens | 100px x 100px | 150px x 150px |
| Mobile Apps | 150px x 150px | 200px x 200px |

### Error Correction Levels
\`\`\`
📊 Choose Based on Environment:
• L (7% recovery): Clean, protected environments
• M (15% recovery): Standard use, light customization
• Q (25% recovery): Moderate customization, logos
• H (30% recovery): Heavy customization, outdoor use
\`\`\`

## 🎯 Logo Integration Best Practices

### The 30% Rule
Never cover more than 30% of the QR code with logos or graphics. Here's how to do it right:

#### Logo Placement Options:
1. **Center Placement** (Most Popular)
   - Maximum logo size: 20% of total area
   - Use circular or square logos
   - Maintain clear borders

2. **Corner Integration**
   - Place in quiet zones
   - Smaller size requirement (10% max)
   - Good for brand watermarks

3. **Frame Integration**
   - Logo outside the code area
   - No size restrictions
   - Maintains 100% scannability

### Logo Design Tips:
\`\`\`
✅ DO:
• Use vector graphics for clarity
• Maintain brand colors
• Test on multiple devices
• Keep simple, recognizable shapes
• Ensure adequate contrast

❌ DON'T:
• Use low-resolution images
• Create complex, detailed logos
• Ignore brand guidelines
• Skip testing phases
• Overcomplicate designs
\`\`\`

## 🌈 Advanced Color Strategies

### Brand-Aligned Color Schemes
Create QR codes that feel native to your brand:

#### Monochromatic Approach:
- Use various shades of your primary brand color
- Maintain high contrast between light and dark elements
- Test thoroughly across devices

#### Complementary Colors:
- Use colors opposite on the color wheel
- Ensure sufficient contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- Consider color blindness accessibility

#### Gradient Effects:
\`\`\`
🎨 Gradient Guidelines:
• Start with high contrast endpoints
• Test middle gradient points for scannability
• Use linear gradients (avoid radial)
• Maintain consistent dark/light patterns
\`\`\`

## 📱 Mobile-First Design Principles

### Screen Compatibility
Design for the smallest screen first:
- iPhone SE: 4.7" screen
- Minimum touch target: 44px x 44px
- Optimal viewing distance: 25-30cm
- Various lighting conditions

### Responsive Sizing:
| Screen Size | QR Code Size | Surrounding Padding |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Mobile (320px) | 150px x 150px | 20px minimum |
| Tablet (768px) | 200px x 200px | 30px minimum |
| Desktop (1200px) | 250px x 250px | 40px minimum |

## 🎭 Creative Design Patterns

### Shape Variations
Move beyond squares with these approaches:

#### Rounded Corners:
- Softens harsh edges
- More approachable feel
- Maintains scannability
- Works well with modern brands

#### Custom Frames:
\`\`\`
🖼️ Frame Ideas:

- "Watch Demo Video" (products)
- "Download App" (software)
- "Connect to WiFi" (hospitality)

### Visual Hierarchy:
