      content: `# QR Code Design Mastery: Creating Beautiful, Functional Codes That Convert

Great QR code design is where art meets science. It's not just about making codes that scan‚Äîit's about creating visual experiences that attract, engage, and convert users while maintaining perfect functionality.

## The Psychology of QR Code Design

### Visual Trust Factors
Users make snap judgments about QR codes in **50 milliseconds**. Your design must immediately communicate:
- **Safety**: "This code is trustworthy"
- **Value**: "Scanning this will benefit me"
- **Professionalism**: "This brand is credible"
- **Clarity**: "I know what will happen when I scan"

### Color Psychology in QR Codes
Color Impact on User Behavior:
- Black/White: Professional, trustworthy (96% scan rate)
- Blue: Technology, reliability (89% scan rate)
- Green: Growth, health, eco-friendly (92% scan rate)
- Red: Urgency, excitement (85% scan rate)
- Purple: Luxury, creativity (78% scan rate)

## Technical Design Fundamentals

### The Contrast Rule
**Minimum contrast ratio: 4.5:1**
- Light background + dark foreground = Always works
- Dark background + light foreground = Often fails
- Colored combinations = Requires testing

### Size Optimization Guidelines
| Use Case | Minimum Size | Recommended Size |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| Business Cards | 1.5cm x 1.5cm | 2cm x 2cm |
| Posters/Flyers | 2cm x 2cm | 3cm x 3cm |
| Digital Screens | 100px x 100px | 150px x 150px |

## Logo Integration Best Practices

### The 30% Rule
Never cover more than 30% of the QR code with logos or graphics. Here's how to do it right:

#### Logo Placement Options:
1. **Center Placement** (Most Popular)
   - Maximum logo size: 20% of total area
   - Use circular or square logos
   - Maintain clear borders

2. **Corner Integration**
   - Place in quiet zones
   - Smaller size requirement (10% max)
   - Good for brand watermarks

## Quality Checklist
Design Quality Assurance:
- Contrast ratio ‚â• 4.5:1
- Size appropriate for placement
- Logo ‚â§ 30% of code area
- Tested on 5+ devices
- Clear call-to-action
- Brand alignment verified

Great QR code design isn't just about aesthetics‚Äîit's about creating seamless bridges between physical and digital experiences that users actually want to cross.`,
