## Before vs After

**Before**: 4 out of 9 QR types had missing content forms
**After**: All 9 QR types have complete, functional input forms

## Validation

- All input forms properly update the QR data state
- Forms validate required fields before QR generation
- Each type generates appropriate QR data format:
  - vCard: Standard vCard format
  - SMS: `sms:` URI scheme
  - WhatsApp: WhatsApp web link format
  - Location: `geo:` URI scheme

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite (`qr-generator.test.tsx`) that validates:

- All QR type buttons are rendered
- Each type switches to correct input form
- All required input fields are present
- Generate button is available for all types

The QR Generator now provides a complete user experience for creating all supported QR code types with proper content input forms.
